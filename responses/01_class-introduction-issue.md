## Step 1: Building Secure Repositories

Welcome to Building Secure Repositories :tada:!

In this course, you'll learn how to build and host a secure repository in GitHub.  A secure repository prevents sensitive data being exposed, enforces secure development best practises for your projects and with correct configurations, safe guards unintended access rights permissions.


In this course you will learn how to:

- Enable Security features for repositories hosted in GitHub
- Detect and fix security vulnerability in repositories when notified by the security vulnerability alert
- Keep updated with security best practises by leveraging the use of a `.gitignore` file
