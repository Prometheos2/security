_Note: You might notice that this project has a `package.json` file, but no `package-lock.json` file. We are doing all parts of this activity on GitHub.com, instead of working with anything locally. If you work with a Node project locally, you might notice some slight differences, but the main concepts discussed here will still completely apply._
