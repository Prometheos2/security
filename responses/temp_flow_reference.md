    - There are several dependencies, one with a known vulnerability
    - Activity: branch and fix this
    - Comment: These are dependencies in this repo's language, `x`. See examples of other dependencies in other languages that are supported "here".
    - How can we know they're secure? It's not always easy, but GitHub is watching out. ðŸ‘€
- ðŸ‘¤ Opens PR (PR should not be able to be merged without approval)

    - A `.gitignore` file is an important way to ignore files that might contain sensitive information.
    - Introduces `.gitignore` in PR
    - Now that we have a `.gitignore`, let's discuss what kind of files we should ignore.
    - One example is a `.env` file. It can contain sensitive information.
      - Possibly also include `.env.local` etc. `.config` possible too. Name can change but concept is the same for all projects.
      - Other generic files with authentication info, anything with passwords
      - Those things are better stored as environment variables, maybe point to OAuth as a GitHub App
    - Open a PR to change the name of the `.env` file, and add it to the `.gitignore`.
- ðŸ‘¤ Add `.env` file to `.gitignore`.
