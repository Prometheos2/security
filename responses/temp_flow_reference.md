    - Now that we have a `.gitignore`, let's discuss what kind of files we should ignore.

      - Possibly also include `.env.local` etc. `.config` possible too. Name can change but concept is the same for all projects.
      - Other generic files with authentication info, anything with passwords
      - Those things are better stored as environment variables, maybe point to OAuth as a GitHub App
    - Open a PR to change the name of the `.env` file, and add it to the `.gitignore`.
