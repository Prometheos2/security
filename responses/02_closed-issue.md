Great work. Because of the available API endpoints, I can't check to see if you've completed the first few steps. But, I can see that you've closed this issue.

Make sure to complete the first few steps in your settings, and you should be able to see your published [project site on GitHub Pages]({{ pages }}). I've opened [another issue with the next steps]({{ url }}).
