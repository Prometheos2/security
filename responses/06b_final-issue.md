Congratulations @{{ user.username }}, you've completed this course!

### What went well

Before I say good-bye, here's a recap of all the tasks you've accomplished in your repository:

- Enable vulnerable dependency detection for private repositories
- Detect and fix outdated dependencies with security vulnerabilities in repositories after being notified by a GitHub vulnerability alert
- Keep sensitive data out of your repository by leveraging the use of a `.gitignore` file

### What's next?

Want to learn more options to secure your repository? Check out the [documentation for security alerts](https://help.github.com/articles/about-security-alerts-for-vulnerable-dependencies/), as well as some [GitHub apps for security](https://github.com/marketplace/category/security) that might help you keep your code safe.
