Congratulations @{{ user.username }}, you've completed this course!

When considering the security of your repository, consider the installed applications, like me. Every app installed on your repository has access to some of your data. Even if it is harmless (like me), it is a good idea to periodically check and prune the list of installed apps and integrations on your repositories. Look for things like active use, or  permissions giving more access than necessary.

### Manage app permissions

As much as it pains me to leave you, I want you to uninstall me from this repository. I won't be able to congratulate you on achieving this task, but know I'm excited about your progress.

Follow the guidelines in [GitHub's documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/reviewing-your-authorized-integrations/#reviewing-your-authorized-github-apps) to review authorized OAuth and GitHub Apps. If you'd like to practice, you can uninstall Learning Lab from this repository.

### What went well

Before I say good-bye, here's a recap of all the tasks you've accomplished in your repository:

- Enable vulnerable dependency detection for private repositories
- Detect and fix outdated dependencies with security vulnerabilities
- Keep sensitive data out of your repository by leveraging the use of a `.gitignore` file

### What's next?

Want to learn more options to secure your repository? Check out the [documentation for security alerts](https://help.github.com/articles/about-security-alerts-for-vulnerable-dependencies/), as well as some [GitHub apps for security](https://github.com/marketplace/category/security) that might help you keep your code safe.
