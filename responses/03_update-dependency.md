## Update the dependency

Now that you know what version is recommended to stay secure, it's time to edit the `package.json` file to upgrade the package to a non-vulnerable version.

> _Note: Before doing this with real world code, it's important to make sure that upgrading to a new package version will function properly with your code. Good unit tests and CI (continuous integration) will help you update confidently._

We'll go through the GitHub Flow to make these changes. If you aren't sure how to do this, try the [Introduction to GitHub course](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github) and then come back to give it another try.
