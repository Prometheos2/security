## Step 1: Building Secure Repositories

### :tada: Welcome to Building Secure Repositories!

In this course, you'll learn how to build and host a secure repository in GitHub.  A secure repository prevents sensitive data being exposed, enforces secure development best practises for your projects and with correct configurations and safe guards unintended access rights permissions.


In this course you will learn how to:

- Opt into vulnerability detection for private repositories. Public repositories hosted in GitHub detects for security vulnerabilities by default
- Detect and fix security vulnerability in repositories when notified by the security vulnerability alert
- Keep updated with security best practises by leveraging the use of a `.gitignore` file

### New to GitHub?

For this course, you'll need to know how to create a branch on GitHub, commit changes using Git, and open a pull request on GitHub. If you need a refresher on the GitHub flow, check out the [the Introduction to GitHub course]({{ host}}/courses/introduction-to-github).

### :keyboard: Activity: Enable Vulnerability alerts

  - Selecting `Web` allows you to access the notifications on GitHub.
  - Selecting `Email each time a vulnerability is found` sends an email to your default notification email.
  - Selecting `Email a digest summary of vulnerabilities` sends a digest email with a summary of up to 10 repositories' vulnerability alerts. Use the drop-down menu to choose to receive digest emails daily or weekly.
5. Close this issue when you're ready.
6. Check for an open Pull Request for next steps.
