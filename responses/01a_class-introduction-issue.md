## Step 1: Building Secure Repositories

### :tada: Welcome to Building Secure Repositories!

In this course, you'll learn how to build and host a secure repository in GitHub.  A secure repository prevents sensitive data from being exposed, enforces secure development best practices, and safe guards unintended access rights permissions.

In this course you will learn how to:

- Opt-in to vulnerability detection for private repositories
  - _Note: These settings are enabled by default for public repositories_
- Detect and fix security vulnerabilities in repositories when notified by the security vulnerability alert
- Keep updated with security best practices by leveraging the use of a `.gitignore` file

To do this, we'll be playing around with the code in this repository that makes a simple game. To deploy this game on GitHub Pages and actually see our improvements in real time, go to the **Settings** tab of this repository, and scroll down to **GitHub Pages**. Select `master` as a **Source**, and click **Save**. GitHub will create a deployment for you on GitHub Pages.

### New to GitHub?

For this course, you'll need to know how to create a branch on GitHub, commit changes using Git, and open a pull request on GitHub. If you need a refresher on the GitHub flow, check out the [the Introduction to GitHub course]({{ host}}/courses/introduction-to-github).

### :keyboard: Activity: Enable Vulnerability alerts

1. Click your profile photo in the upper-right corner of any page, then click **Settings**.
1. In the user settings sidebar, click **Notifications**.
1. Under "Vulnerability alerts", configure how you would like to receive notifications when GitHub detects a vulnerable dependency in your repository:
  - Selecting `UI alerts` displays a banner in the GitHub interface.
  - Selecting `Web` allows you to access the notifications on GitHub.
  - Selecting `Email each time a vulnerability is found` sends an email to your default notification email.
  - Selecting `Email a digest summary of vulnerabilities` sends a digest email with a summary of up to 10 repositories' vulnerability alerts. Use the drop-down menu to choose to receive digest emails daily or weekly.
1. Close this issue.
