## :tada: Welcome to Securing your workflows!

In this course, you'll learn how to build and host a secure repository in GitHub.  A secure repository prevents sensitive data from being exposed, enforces secure development best practices, and safe guards unintended access rights permissions.

In this course you will learn how to:

- Opt-in to vulnerability detection for private repositories
  - _Note: These settings are enabled by default for public repositories that are not forks._
- Detect and fix security vulnerabilities in repositories when notified by the security vulnerability alert
- Keep updated with security best practices by leveraging the use of a `.gitignore` file

### New to GitHub?

For this course, you'll need to know how to create a branch on GitHub, commit changes using Git, and open a pull request on GitHub. If you need a refresher on the GitHub flow, check out the [the Introduction to GitHub course]({{ host}}/courses/introduction-to-github).

### :keyboard: Activity: Enable Vulnerability alerts & GitHub Pages

**Is your repository public?** If so, only complete **step 1** and **step 4**. These features are enabled by default on public repositories. If this is a **private repository**, continue with the instructions here.

1. Click the **Settings** tab in your repository.
1. Scroll down until you see **Data services**.
1. Under **Data services**, click the check boxes to enable all of the data services.
1. Scroll down to **GitHub Pages**. Select `master` as a **Source**, and click **Save**.

> Turning on GitHub Pages creates a deployment of your repository. I may take up to a minute to respond as I await the deployment.
